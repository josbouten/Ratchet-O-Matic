Ratchet-O-Matic
===============
There are 3 modes, DIV, MULT and MAX_MULT.
In DIV-mode the input gates are devided by a number.
This number is determined by the maximum value read from the FREQ-pot and the FREQ-CV input.
Whether any division is done depends on the highest value read from the CHANCE-pot and CHANCE CV-input.
This value is converted into a probability running from 0 to 1. A higher probability makes it more likely that
a gate signal will be generated.
The gate in frequency can be divide by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 16.

In MULT-mode the input gates are multiplied by a factor 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
This multiplication number is determined by the maximum value read from the FREQ-pot and the FREQ-CV input.
If the factor is 1 then the '1'-led will light up.

In MULT_MAX mode the number of ratchets varies at random from a minimum value set by the FREQ-knob
to a maximum value determined by the CV-input value.

Switching from DIV to MULT or DIV to MAX_MULT can be done by pressing the mode button once.
Switching from MAX_MULT to MULT and vv can be done in either mode by quickly double pressing the mode button.

Basic use of Ratchet-O-Matic
============================

0: make sure you have the following chain of modules prepared:
0a: an oscillator which produces a constant signal. Its pitch should be set. This oscillator is
0b: patched into a VCA (which has a gate input), which is
0c: patched into an amplifier with a speaker.
0d: prepare a clock source.

1: set the external clock to a slow pattern
   For beginners this makes it easier to discover the things Ratchet-O-Matic can do for you.
2a: connect the clock to the 'SHIFT'-input of the 960 sequencer,
2b: connect the clock output to the ‘clock in’ of the Ratchet-O-matic module,
2c: make sure the mode is set to ‘MUL’ (MULT-led is continuously lit) or 'MULT_MAX' (MULT-led will flash).
    MULT is the default mode when first switched on. After that the device will remember which
    state you last set it to.

3: connect the ‘gate out’ of Ratchet-O-Matic to the ‘gate’ of the VCA

4: choose the mode (MULT/DIV/MAX_MULT) using the mode button.

5: set a frequency with the FREQ-knob. Turned fully counterclockwise the frequency = 0,
   no gate signal pulse will be sent to the output.
   Turned fully clockwise, the frequency is 5 when in ratchet mode. In divide mode the frequency is 1/16
   The clock in frequency can be divide by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 16 in DIV mode.
   The clock in frequency is multiplied by a factor 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. in (MAX_)MULT mode.
   When set to 1 the '1'-led will light up.

6: use the CHANCE-knob or connect a cv value to the chance-in input to set the odds that a ratchet or divided
   clock will be passed to the output. In MAX_MULT the chance pot and cv-value are ignored.

How to use Ratchet-O-Matic incombination with a 960 sequencer
=============================================================

0: make sure you have the following chain of modules prepared:
0a: an oscillator which produces a constant signal (either tone or noise),
0b: patched into a VCA (which has a gate input),
0c: patched into an amplifier with a speaker.
0d: prepare a clock source.

1: set the external clock to a slow pattern,

2a: connect the clock to the 'SHIFT'-input of the 960 sequencer,
2b: connect the clock output to the ‘clock in’ of the Ratchet-O-matic module,
2c: make sure the mode is set to ‘MUL’ = multiply, the LED should then light up,
That is the default mode, but the device will remember in what state you switched it off,
so you may have to set it to ‘MUL’,

3: connect the ‘gate out’ of Ratchet-O-Matic to the ‘gate’ of the VCA

4: Choose the MULT-mode using the mode button. The MULT-led should be lit continously.
   When the MULT-led is flashing you are in the MAX_MULT mode. Double click the button to
   return to the MULT mode.

5: press the “osc off” button of the 960. It should not run on its own oscillator,

6: connect a patch cable from the bottom row of the 960 to the ‘chance-in’ input of Ratchet-O-Matic,

7: connect a patch cable from the middle row of the 960 to the ‘freq-in’ input of Ratchet-O-Matic,

8: connect a patch cable from the top row of the 960 to the ‘V/Oct-in’ of the audio oscillator,

9a: set the bottom row chicken knob of the 960 to ‘X2’,
9b: set the pots of the bottom row of the 960 all far beyond the center position.
    This should set the odds for them to fire all the time high enough.
    The ‘Chance LED’ should be lit all the time,

10a: set the middle chicken knob to ‘X2’,
10b: set most of the pots of the middle row of the 960 below the center position and a few
     above the center position. Below a certain voltage no clock will be on the output, given a slightly
     higher voltage one clock pulse will reach the output. Higher voltages will result in ratcheting.
     The higher the voltage the more pulses will reach the output,
10c: when using a noise generator you can skip setting the 960 pots in the top row, otherwise choose
     set a tone sequence.

11: set the 'Chance knob' on Ratchet-O-Matic to 0, so that the odds are only determined
    by the input signal on the 'chance'-input,

12: set the 'freq knob' on Ratchet-O-Matic to 0, so that the number of ratchets is only
    determined by the input signal on the 'freq'-input. The number of gate pulses per step can
    be set using the potmeters to be 0 up to 5.

13a: Start with rather low ratchet settings and contrast them with rather high settings to find your bearing.
13b: Then fine tune and set the number of ratchets you like. Lower some of the odds pots so that not all
     notes are ratcheted.

How to get a random number of ratchets
======================================
Double click the mode button until the MULT-led flashes. You are in MAX_MULT mode now.
In this mode, the settings of the "freq"-knob determines the minimum number of
ratchets i.e. output gates. The maximum number of gates is determined by the CV value.

The lowest number of gates you can set when the knob is set to 0.
When set to 1 the '1'-led will light up to signal this. For higher values of the Potentiometers,
the '1'-led is off and the number of gates is 2 or more.

The chance knob and CV input are of no effect on the number of gate outs in this mode.

How to use Ratchet-O-Matic as a clock divider
=============================================
Make the same connections as above and set the mode to 'DIV' using the mode button.
Now the highest value of 'freq'-pot and 'freq-in' cv-value determines the division factor.
DIV can divide by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 16. A value of 1 means that for each note a gate
os produced, so you should hear all notes. For higher values notes will be skipped. This can lead
to interesting polyrhythms.

Note:

1: the pots can produce a voltage between a maximum and a minimum value and the chicken
   knobs on the 960 determine in what range that is. Switching the chicken knob will
   change the range of all pots of the corresponding row.

2: when using the CV inputs, note that Ratchet-O-Matic chooses the highest value of the
   input and the corresponding knob value. This goes for Ratcheting or Division
   frequency and the odds settings.

2: when in MULT or DIV mode Ratchet-O-Matic chooses the highest value of the
   input and the corresponding knob value to determine the number of gates or the
   odds of producing a gate. In these modes Ratchet-O-Matic can be used without any CV inputs.
   In MAX_MULT however, a CV value on the FREQ-in is necessary. It will set the maximum count of
   ratchets while the FREQ-knob will set the minimum number of ratchets.
